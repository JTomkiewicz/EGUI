## Description

Graphical User Interfaces was, in my opinion, one of the most interesting subjects. It discussed creating graphical user interfaces in programs for both Windows and Unix-based systems. 

## Laboratories

The task was to create one type of application in `three different technologies`: 

- Qt (C++)
- MVC dotnet (C#)
- React.js (JavaScript) with Express backend

The application intends to serve as a `shopping list`. Its is a typical `CRUD` (crate, read, update and delete) so user can add any dishes, delete them and edit the ingredients the given dish consists of. 

In addition, there is also a module summarizing how many ingredients users should buy for a selected list of dishes.

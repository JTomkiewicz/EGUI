## Description

EGUI was, in my opinion, one of the most interesting subjects. It discussed creating graphical user interfaces in programs for both Windows and Linux. 

## Laboratories

The task was to create one type of application in three different technologies: 
* Qt (C++)
* MVC dotnet (C#)
* React (JavaScript)

The application intends to serve as a shopping list. User can add any dishes, delete them and edit the ingredients the given dish consists of. In addition, there is also a module summarizing how many ingredients users should buy for a selected list of dishes.
